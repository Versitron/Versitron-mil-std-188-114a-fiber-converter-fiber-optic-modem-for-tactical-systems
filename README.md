## Purpose & Function

Military serial-to-fiber converters securely transport data from legacy serial communication equipment—such as RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485—over fiber optic cables. This ensures:
- **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) immunity** for uncompromised signal integrity.
- **Long-distance reach** far beyond copper limitations.
- **Secure and non-radiating transmission** for classified communications.
